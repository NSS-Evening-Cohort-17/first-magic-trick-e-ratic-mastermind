                    <p>Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker in Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man is near perfection in terms of not only staying true to the comic book character's personality, but also just succeeding in being the most enjoyable actor to watch bring the character to life. Spider-Man isn't the only character that is well developed, as almost every side character was given memorable and recognizable traits that made them feel relevant to the story. Tobey Maguire was the best Spider-Man and was in the best Spider-Man movies.</p>
